# Migrant's journey to Singapore (Nanyang) 
 It had been countless hazy hours, maybe even days, or months. The dark, dingy ship rocked in turbulence, the rushing storm and waves drowning out the groans from the ship's cramped interior, of those slumped on the floor and all over each other. They were feeble and limp, chests rising shallowly in the attempt to breathe in the warm, musty air turned damp from the humidity. The only light came from the stormy sky outside the ship, seeping through the slits between the wooden planks of the low walls in single rays, and providing fleeting moments of illumination as the lightning sharpened the shadows all around, overwhelming colours in blinding white and dyeing shadows yet darker. The darkness further narrowed the area of the limited space they all shared, smelling of sweat, mould and the piercing, vile stench of what little food the unsteady waves had forced out of many of them. 
 A young maiden with clear, delicate features and eyes hollow as bruises was slumped back, ill-fitting long tunic and trousers draped on her body, the coarse cloth pooling out onto the floorboards. The wooden plank wall behind her creaked as she did so, but not to her knowledge; her gaze lingered on a limp figure on the other side, across from her and her sleeping mother. 
 Even in his sleep, a young man of no more than seventeen years was curled into a ball, clothes too loose for his thinning stature. The dim light of the ship's interior threw blurred shadows across his face scatteredly, casting his tanned skin into near-darkness. Beads of sweat rolled across his forehead and down his tense brow, and entire body stiff as a board, he murmured a name. She could hear it clearly, with all its hush and lowness, even through the deafening torrent outside, even from across the sea of people in between them. 
 "Mèimèi," he whispered between pale, dry lips, emaciated body shrinking back tighter in all subconsciousness, "Ah Min, don't leave me... don't go..." 
 He said the name with so much tenderness, so much sorrow, it latched onto the heart of the young lass of similar age and didn't loosen its grip. Tendrils of shadow spiralled across her face to the lurching of the ship, and the dull ache deep within her chest rose to form a warm pressure behind her eyes despite all her struggle not to. Her gaze lowered to the damp wooden boards, just so she would not have to look at his moment of vulnerability, to give him the privacy he deserved; knees hugged tight to her chest as she swayed along to the rhythm of the torrent that swelled and declined as if it couldn't make up its mind. 
 There was a scarcely perceptible tug on her sleeve behind her. "Ma," she immediately turned round to attend to her mother. The deep-set scars of creases on her mother's forehead deepened as she was rocked to consciousness. Bit by bit, the frail old woman opened her eyes, carved crow's feet blooming from the corners of her natural squint. She slowly parted her lips. "Siew-ah," she whispered hoarsely. 
 "Yes, Ma?" She quickly brushed away the tears in her eyes and bent forward to seek her mother's gaze, long braids falling over both shoulders. 
 "Don't be sad any more." 
 Her mother's voice was soft yet firm, gentle yet unyielding, but even so, hesitant. Siew almost swallowed, emotion building up in her throat. 
 "Don't be sad for him any more," her mother said again, voice thin and tired eyes distant. "Nanyang will have many more challenges for you to face. You must build up a thick skin, that will help you get stronger." 
 Siew bit her lip, tears that had come fom nowhere close to spilling over. "But Ma," she whispered forlornly, voice thick and shaky; straining to hold back. Yet somehow everything she held back, told everything she didn't know how to say. 
 "Be strong," her mother whispered. "He will be strong too."

  Not long after boarding the ship, Siew remembered that across from her mother and her had been a young man of similar age, about seventeen, and a pale, pinched girl. Siew would often watch them from across. 
  The 
  The little girl who had a steady tread and a graceful smile had looked up to him. She had a knowing glint in her eye that disappeared when she amused her brother or had long heart-to-heart talks with him, that reappeared whenever the hint of a smile finally broke through his composed, reserved demeanour.
