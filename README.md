# Migrant's journey to Singapore (Nanyang) 
 It had been countless hazy hours, maybe even days, or months. The dark, dingy ship rocked in turbulence, the rushing storm and waves drowning out the groans from the ship's cramped interior, of those sprawled on the floor and all over each other. They were feeble and limp, chests rising shallowly in the attempt to breathe in the warm, musty air turned damp from the humidity. The only light came from the stormy sky outside the ship, seeping through the slits between the wooden planks of the low walls in single rays, and providing fleeting moments of illumination as the lightning sharpened the shadows all around, overwhelming colours in blinding white and dyeing shadows yet darker. The shadows further narrowed the area of the limited space they all shared, smelling of sweat, mould and the piercing, vile stench of what little food the unsteady waves had forced out of many of them. 
 Even in his sleep, a young man of no more than seventeen years curled into a ball, clothes too loose for his thinning stature. The dim light of the ship's interior threw blurred shadows freely across his face, casting his tanned skin into near-darkness. Beads of sweat rolled across his forehead and down his tense brow, and he muttered a name, her name. 
 "Ah Min," he whispered between pale, dry lips, emaciated body shrinking back tighter in all subconsciousness, "Ah Min, don't leave me... don't go..." 
 He said her name with so much tenderness, so much sorrow, it latched onto Siew's heart and didn't loosen its grip. Tendrils of shadow spiralled across her face to the lurching of the ship, and the dull ache deep within her chest rose to become warm pressure behind her eyes. She lowered her gaze to the damp wooden boards just so she would not have to look at his moment of vulnerability, to give him the privacy he deserved, knees hugged tight to her chest as she swayed along to the rhythm of the torrent that swelled and declined as if it couldn't make up its mind. 
 There was a tug on her sleeve behind her. "Ma," she immediately turned round to attend to her mother. The deep-set creases on her mother's forehead reappeared as she was rocked to consciousness. Bit by bit, the frail old woman opened her eyes, carved crow's feet blooming from the corners of her natural squint. "Siew-ah," she whispered hoarsely. 
 "Yes, Ma?" She quickly brushed away the tears in her eyes and bent forward to give her mother her full attention, long braids falling over both shoulders. 
 "Don't be sad any more." 
 Her mother's voice was soft yet firm, gentle yet unyielding, but even so, hesitant. Siew almost swallowed, emotion building up in her throat. 
 "Don't be sad for him any more," her mother said again, voice thin. "Nanyang will have many more challenges for you to face. You must build up a thick skin, that will help you get stronger." 
 Siew bit her lip, tears close to spilling over. "But Ma," she said, voice thick and shaky, straining to hold back,
